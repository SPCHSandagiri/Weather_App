Description:
A Node.js-based weather application that provides weather information based on the userâ€™s location. It uses Express.js for handling routes, Handlebars (hbs) as the templating engine, and Axios to fetch geolocation and weather data from external APIs.

Features:
*Home Page: Allows users to input a location and get weather data.
*Weather API Integration: Fetches geolocation data using the OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API.
*Multiple Views: Handlebars templates for dynamic rendering (home, help, about, and weather pages).
*Reusable Navigation: Includes reusable navigation partial across different pages.

Technologies Used:
*Node.js
*Express.js: Server-side framework for handling routing.
*Handlebars (hbs): Templating engine for rendering HTML views.
*Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API calls.
*Nodemon: For automatic server restarts during development.
*OpenWeatherMap API: Used to fetch geolocation data.

Project Structure:
*src/: Contains the main server code (app.js).
*public/: Holds static assets like JavaScript and CSS files.
*template/: Handlebars templates for different views (home, help, about, weather).
*utils/: Utility files for API requests, such as geolocation logic (geo.js).

How to Run:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. Run the application: npm start

API Configuration:
This project uses the OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API for fetching geolocation data. You need an API key from OpenWeatherMap to use the service.

* Sign up at OpenWeatherMap.
* Replace the API key in geo.js with your own key
** const url = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q=' + location + '&limit=1&appid=YOUR_API_KEY'; **

Intended Users:
This project is ideal for developers or students who want to learn about working with APIs, using Handlebars for templating, and building a basic web app with Express.js.

Future Plans:
*Add weather data display for the fetched geolocation.
*Implement more detailed weather forecasting using the OpenWeatherMap Weather API.
*Improve the UI for mobile responsiveness.
